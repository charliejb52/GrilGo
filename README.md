I currently work at the Falls Road Grill in Potomac MD. This started as a personal project aimed towards streamlining the schedule generating and keeping processes there, but has now become something I want to build out to apply to any small business needing a scheduling solution.

There is a lot of work to be done to get it to that point, but I have enjoyed learning so much from the little progress I've already made, and look forward to learning much more.
